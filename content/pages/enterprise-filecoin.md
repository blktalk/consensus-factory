          **Centralized**


          * A handful of companies have become the dominant platforms for the
          internet, leading to limited offerings in the cloud storage space

          * Limited set of locations and regions available

          * Dominant cloud interfaces prevent lower level protocol innovation
          (peer to peer)


          **Fragile**

          * Lack of network stability in the infrastructure leads to data
          accessibility issues

          * Vendor lock-in concentrates risk with one provider

          * Public cloud providers have various backup methodologies, not all
          will suit enterprise needs


          **Costly**


          * Organizations are locked into specific architectures with high
          egress and data migration costs

          * Non-predictive cost structure

          * Data lock-in makes price renegotiation hard

          **Decentralized**
          * No single point of failure
          * Multi-mode access: no proprietary protocol, no vendor lock-in
          * Designed for innovation on all levels
          * Storage agnostic at storage provider level

          **Robust**
          * Daily Bit cryptographic data proofing
          * Always available data via verified replication
          * Providers are incentivized to stay **online 24/7,** or lose pledge

          **Efficient**
          * Open spot market for storage
          * Incentive structures enabling cheap prices*
          * Store 6 copies easily
          * Data stored closer of publicly consumable data

      **"Unlike other solutions in this space, most of the storage providers in
      the Filecoin network have committed to offering datacenter resources, and
      have made an important initial investment in both hardware and collateral,
      to ensure the quality of the service, data availability, and long-term
      reliability."**

      Today, Protocol Labs is announcing a temporary referral fee program to

      Invite your customers and help create the data gravity pull!

        text: >-
          Earth’s acceleration of gravity is \~9.81m/s^2, or in other words, an
          object falling freely will accelerate by about 9.81 meters per second
          every single second. In a similar way, the larger the datasets, the
          faster other and smaller data sets will gravitate towards it, also
          referred to as data gravity. So help us make data gravity work and
          bring your customer’s large datasets to the Filecoin network and get a
          referral fee paid!

        text: >-
          The Filecoin network reached 10EiB in August, which no other useful
          distributed storage stack has ever accomplished in such a short time.
          The combination of a clear vision, a solid technology stack, and
          thoughtfully-aligned incentive programs have helped raise Filecoin to
          the top. There are currently more than 3,000 Filecoin systems and
          storage providers in more than 44 countries serving capacity to a vast
          ecosystem of 400+ applications and thousands of developers.
      - headline: The program
        subhead: ''
        text: >-
          This is a limited time referral promo that incentivizes any community
          member to bring forward a prospective client of a certain size. The
          referral fee is awarded to an individual or organization that
          registers and ensures a customer commitment to start a Filecoin POC
          (Proof of Concept).


          This program is active now and has a registration referral deadline of
          December 1st 2021.
      - headline: Award amounts
        subhead: ''

          * Earn 100FIL for a 100TiB+ dataset

          * Earn 500FIL for a 1PiB+ dataset


          \*The prices of blockchain assets can be volatile. The value of the
          award will be affected by the price of FIL at the time of the FIL
          transfer. You can refer to the current price of FIL.
      - headline: Who can participate?

          Anyone who wants to participate can bring a customer to the table and

      - headline: What kind of datasets are we looking for?
        subhead: ''
        text: >-
          * To be eligible, the minimum POC capacity is a 100TiB

          * Data should be static and infrequently accessed

          * Data should not require encryption

          * Dataset needs to have “public good” characteristics — have social
          justice, life sciences, environmental or cultural heritage value
          (e.g., climate change, scientific research datasets, museum or art
          collection archives)
      - headline: What are the award conditions?
        subhead: ''
        text: >-
          * The referrer needs to submit the proposed organization through the
          registration form

          * The customer or use case should be net new to the community

          * The customer agrees to be showcased as a Filecoin user and
          collaborate on marketing and PR efforts

          * POC is officially initiated when the first sector is sealed

          * POC needs to be initiated before Dec 1, 2021 and a clear POC plan
          needs to be defined

          * A referrer can be eligible for multiple rewards (one reward per
          client referred)
      - headline: What is the referrer responsible for?
        subhead: ''

          * Submitting this registration form (following form submission, the
          Filecoin team will reach out to the referrer)

          * Making an introduction and setting up the initial meetings to
          connect the Filecoin working group organization with the prospective
          customer

          * Supporting the relationship and conversations between the Filecoin
          working group and the prospective customer until the POC agreement is
          reached and the program is kicked off

          * Once a mutual agreement has been reached and a POC is initiated, the
          referrer is eligible for the referral bonus
      - headline: Other
        subhead: ''
        text: >-
          Nonprofit organizations that decide to onboard data onto Filecoin are
          also eligible for the referral bonus in the form of a grant.


          Protocol Labs reserves the right to adjust or cancel this program at
          any time, and disclaims any duty or responsibility other than the
          payment of referral fees as set forth in this program description.
