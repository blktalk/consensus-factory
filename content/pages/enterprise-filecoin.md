          #### Centralized


          * A handful of companies have become the dominant platforms for the
          internet, leading to limited offerings in the cloud storage space

          * Limited set of locations and regions available

          * Dominant cloud interfaces prevent lower level protocol innovation
          (peer to peer)

          #### Fragile


          * Dominant cloud interfaces prevent lower level protocol innovation
          (peer to peer)

          * Vendor lock-in concentrates risk with one provider

          * Public cloud providers have various backup methodologies, not all
          will suit enterprise needs
