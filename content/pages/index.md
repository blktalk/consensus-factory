    headline: Vector Commitment
    subhead: Research Day
    body: >
      Vector commitments are powerful primitives that find applications in many
      blockchains protocols. The goal of this workshop is to survey the state of
      the art in research in Vector Commitments with survey talks, the
      presentation of recent breakthrough results and discussions about the
      important open problems, and how they are motivated by practical
      applications.

        text: >
          Are Merkle trees a panacea? In this talk, I argue they are not and
          present several tree-based vector commitments that offer interesting
          trade-offs when compared to Merkleâ€™s classic construction. First, I
          will cover previous work on tree-based VCs from polynomial commitments
          and lattices. Unlike Merkle trees, these constructions have a
          combination of smaller proof sizes, useful homomorphisms and more
          efficient proof aggregation.

        text: >
          Vector commitments (VCs) allow one to commit concisely to an ordered
          sequence of values, so that the values at desired positions can later
          be concisely and verifiably revealed. In addition, a VC can be
          statelessly updatable, meaning that commitments and proofs can be
          updated to reflect changes to individual entries, using knowledge of
          just those changes (and not the entire vector). To date, there have
          been relatively few post-quantum constructions.
